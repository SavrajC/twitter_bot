Serverless Twitter bot that tweets geeky jokes Link to twitter bot is here: https://twitter.com/DailyJokesBot_

Meant as a small pick me up throughout the working day. Tweets right before 9 and another tweet at 3:45 when the brain starts to slow down from mental fatigue.

Tweets every 7 Hours and 45 mins MON-FRI. Posts right before the working day at 8:45 for a small dumb joke to start the day.

Code can be copied and replace the URL to any API to tweet out whatever you want.

Feel free to fork the repo and try out some cool API's to tweet to see how it works.
